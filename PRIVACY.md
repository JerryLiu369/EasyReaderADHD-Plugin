# Privacy Policy for EasyReaderADHD

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Overview

EasyReaderADHD is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect:**
- Personal information (name, email, IP address, etc.)
- Browsing history or URLs visited
- Page content or reading material
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Cookies or tracking data

## Local Storage

All user settings and preferences are stored **locally in your browser only**. This includes:
- Enabled/disabled status
- Color themes and custom color selections
- Font size, letter spacing, and font weight preferences
- Language and dictionary selections
- Processing mode preferences

**These settings are never transmitted to our servers or any third party.**

## How the Extension Works

When you enable EasyReaderADHD:
1. The extension analyzes text on web pages you visit
2. It identifies words and their parts of speech
3. It applies color highlighting based on your settings
4. All processing happens locally on your device

**No data leaves your browser.**

## Optional LLM Integration

If you choose to configure an LLM (Large Language Model) API:
- You must explicitly provide the API endpoint and authentication key
- Text data is sent only to your configured service (e.g., OpenAI, Aliyun)
- We do not control, monitor, or store this data
- **You are responsible for reviewing that service's privacy policy**

This is entirely optional and disabled by default.

## Permissions Explanation

### `<all_urls>` Permission
The extension requests access to all websites to enable text highlighting on any page you visit. This does **not** grant us access to your data—it only allows the extension to function across different websites.

### `storage` Permission
Used solely to save your preferences locally in your browser.

## Third-Party Services

The extension includes:
- **Dictionary data**: Pre-loaded, never transmitted
- **Optional LLM APIs**: Only if you explicitly configure them

We do not partner with any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Continued use of the extension constitutes acceptance of any changes.
